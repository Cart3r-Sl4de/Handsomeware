# Handsomeware

## #####---WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM---#####

This handsomeware is pretty much my spiteful response to Windows not allowing password protection for files you want to protect. It also
is my spiting software that requires one to pay in order to have security, when security and privacy is something that should be an innate right.

Amidst the spite, the way that this allows privacy and protection, is the fact that this software encrypts all the files in whatever folder
you put it in (does not go up or down file hierarchy, is just the files that are in the set folder). The kicker about this software is,
it is halfway ransomware (which is sorta how I came up with the title Handsomeware), but unlike ransomware, this is encryption that you control,
as after you execute the encryption part of the Handsomeware, YOU have the key that decrypts the gibberish that results from the encryption
(much to the dismay of whoever tries to read your files).

## ####---HOW TO USE IT---####

Before encrypting and/or decrypting, put the executable file in the folder of which its contents you want to encrypt, and then run the exe.

If you have a good antivirus, then because of the mid-way ransomware in the code, the antivirus could block the exe from running, If so, you
would need to set an exception for it in the antivirus screen.

From there, the program will walk you through the process of operating the software. If you choose to encrypt with key generation, it of
course will proceed to encrypt and generate a key file. If you choose to encrypt with an existing key, then of course the handsomeware would
do such! You can even set a name for the key, to make it easier to know which key corresponds to which files.

For decryption, first make sure you have the key file in the file where the executable and encrypted files are. Then, if the program has closed
after encryption, run the program again and follow the prompts and of course select decrypt. Then, the files will be legible/usable once again!
